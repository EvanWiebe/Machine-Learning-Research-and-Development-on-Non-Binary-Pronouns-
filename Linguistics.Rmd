## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
data1 <- read.delim("~/Desktop/Corpus/ndy_utf8.tsv", sep = "\t")
```


```{r}
data2 <- read.delim("~/Desktop/Corpus/meta.tsv", sep = "\t")
```


```{r}
data |>
  filter( 'Lol' %in% Text)
  
```
```{r}
data |>
  filter("Lol" %in% Text)

```
```{r}
search_word = " xier "
data[grepl(search_word, data$Text), ]
```
```{r}
data23 <- read.delim("~/Desktop/Corpus/final_comments_corpus.csv", sep = "\t")
```
```{r}
data23 <- read.delim("~/Desktop/~/Desktop/Stuff2/final_comments_corpus.csv", sep = "\t")
```

```{r}
data2223 <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Stuff2/final_comments_corpus.csv")
```


```{r}

data2223

```

```{r}

search_word = " xier "
 data2223[grepl(search_word, data2223$Comment), ]

```
