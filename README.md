# Machine-Learning-Research-and-Development-on-Non-Binary-Pronouns-

This ongoing research project investigates the use of non-binary pronouns in the German language through machine learning.

Project Focus:

Topic Modeling and NLP: Train a topic model and a basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to analyze the usage patterns of non-binary pronouns in German text.
Anomaly Detection: Implement an Isolation Forest algorithm to enhance the model's ability to identify deviations from regular pronoun usage patterns.
Predictive Analysis: Develop methods to predict pronoun use in casual German language based on the extracted features.
This project contributes to the understanding of non-binary pronoun usage and explores the potential of machine learning for analyzing linguistic phenomena.
